
SYNOPSIS
    stty 
    rimbox
DESCRIPTION
    sets line separator to vertical bar and end-of-line to carriage
    return.  This is the default setting when the microcontroller
    is powered up.  Using vertical bar as a line separator accomodates
    returning multiple lines to the rimbox virtual asynchronous 
    channel which terminates its request-response session when it
    reads a carriage return.
