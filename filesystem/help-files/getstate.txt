
SYNOPSIS
    state 
    getstate 
DESCRIPTION
    displays current state of the autostart state machine 

OVERVIEW
    The states vector is a 32 bit vector. Each state ORs the
    state vector with its bit. The eight LSBs are responsible for
    the state itself, whereas higher bits represents error
    states. Stable low and stable high temperature clears
    the eight LSB first, before setting the respective bit.

    0x000000 - not initialized (or manual autostart)
    0x000001 - started initialization
    0x000002 - started vacuum pumping
    0x000004 - init cooling
    0x000008 - cooling down - power
    0x000010 - cooling down - temp/stable low temp
    0x000020 - heating up
    0x000040 - switching off
    0x000080 - stable high temp (shutdown) state
    0x000100 - e000 occurred (auto start init)
    0x000200 - e001 occurred (vac creation)
    0x000400 - e002 occurred (vac rot speed error)
    0x000800 - e003 occurred (vac power error)
    0x001000 - e004 occurred (serious cryo/vac comm error)
    0x002000 - e005 occurred (vac rot speed error with cryo running)
    0x004000 - e006 occurred (cryo init comm error)
    0x008000 - e007 occurred (rot speed on heatup error)
    0x010000 - e008 occurred (cold init error)
    0x020000 - e009 occurred (vac cold start error)
    0x040000 - e010 occurred (vac rpm oscilation)
    0x080000 - e011 occurred (cryo motor temp issue)
    0x100000 - temp readout problem (A5/A6)
    0x200000 - e012 occurred (cryo down while low)
