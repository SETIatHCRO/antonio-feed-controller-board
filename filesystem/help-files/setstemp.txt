
SYNOPSIS
    setswitchtemp temp 
DESCRIPTION
    Change the switch temperature [K] of the autostart routine.
    When the diode reaches that temperature, the mode changes
    from a constant 70W to a temperature control loop with slowly
    increasing maximum power allowance. The switch temperature is
    saved in the flash filesystem such that after a reset or power
    cycle, the value is restored.

EXAMPLES
    setswitchtemp 125.0
