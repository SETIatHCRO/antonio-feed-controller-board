
SYNOPSIS
    setswitchtemp temp 
DESCRIPTION
    Change the switch temperature [K] of the autostart routine.
    When the diode reaches that temperature, the mode changes
    from constant 70W to temperature control loop with slowly
    increasing maximum power allowance. The switch temperature is
    saved in the flash filesystem such that after a reset or power
    cycle, the value is restored.

EXAMPLES
    setswitchtemp 125.0
