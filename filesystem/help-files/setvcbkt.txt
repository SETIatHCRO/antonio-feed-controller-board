
SYNOPSIS
    setbackingtime mins
DESCRIPTION
    Change the backing up pump run time at the beginning of autostart
    routines, before turbo pump is switched on
    Long backing time reliefs the turbo pump stress
    but extends the autostart routine duration. The time is
    saved in the flash filesystem such that after a reset or power
    cycle, the value is restored.
