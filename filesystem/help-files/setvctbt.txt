
SYNOPSIS
    setturbotime mins
DESCRIPTION
    Change the turbo pump (full throttle) time at the beginning of the autostart
    routines. After this time period, the turbo power and RPM are
    checked to indicate the state of the vacuum. If a good vacuum is not
    established after that time, the turbo pump goes back to standby mode.
    The time is saved in the flash filesystem such that after
    a reset or power cycle, the value is restored.

EXAMPLES
    setturbotime 15
