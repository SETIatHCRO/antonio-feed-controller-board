
SYNOPSIS
    setturbotime mins
DESCRIPTION
    Change the turbo pump (full throttle) time at the beginning of autostart
    routines. After this time period, the turbo power and RPM are being
    checked to indicate a state of the vacuum. If good vacuum is not established
    after that time, the turbo pump goes back to standby mode
    The time is saved in the flash filesystem such that after
    a reset or power cycle, the value is restored.

EXAMPLES
    setturbotime 15
